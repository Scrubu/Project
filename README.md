Project Wayez Chowdhury and Kyle Lai
=======


AP Computer Science final project for Fall Term 2014<br>
Anti-gravity platform game. <bl>
<ul><li>
Player cannot jump.</li>
<li>Can only reverse gravity</li>
<li>Similar to vvvvvv</li>
</ul><br><br>
Features:
<ol>
<li>obstacles</li>
<li>Player must last as long as possible while avoiding obstacles, similar to gravity guy
</ol>

January 7, 2015:<ul>
<li>Created processing file Gravity.pde</li>
<li>Learned some processing tricks</li>
<li>Added basic movement for protagonist</li>
<li>Created Gravity that affects the protaganist</li>
</ul><br><br>

January 8, 2015:<ul>
<li>Updated Gravity to run smoother, used KeyRelease instead of KeyPressed</li>
<li>Fixed bug that led to infinite gravity change</li>
<li>Created Hero.pde</li>
</ul><br><br>

January 9, 2015:<ul>
<li>Fixed bug that prevented movement</li>
<li>Updated movement to run smoother</li>
<li>Added gravitational acceleration</li>
</ul><br><br>

January 10, 2015:<ul>
<li>Made transition from moving left to right smooth without any delays</li>
<li>Fixed gravity bug where player would go offscreen by reversing gravity midair</li>
</ul><br><br>

January 12, 2015<ul>
<li>Fixed bug that did not allow player to reverse gravity</li>
<li>Gravitational acceleration is now canceled after player switches gravitational direction</li>
<li>Integrated Hero class into code</li>
<li>Created obstacle class</li>
</ul><br><br>

January 14, 2015<ul>
<li>Started cleaning up main gravity class by moving functions to the Hero class</li>
</ul><br><br>

January 15, 2015<ul>
<li>Finished cleaning up main class</li>
<li>Added mutator and accessor methods in Hero class to get its properties</li>
<li>began working on collision with obstacles</li>
</ul><br><br>

January 17, 2015<ul>
<li>worked more on collision</li>
<li>implemented sprite</li>
</ul><br><br>
